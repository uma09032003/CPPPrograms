InvoiceManagement.cpp
The Program provides a CLI Solution to the BillManagement Problem(Case Study) in small scale shops. The following assumptions and features are made and provided by the 
project code respectively.
  1. ShopKeeper generates the bill using a CLI. She/He knows the basic commands to access the system.
  2. Commands :
     (a) 'c' -> To start generating a new Invoice
     (b) 'i' -> To read the generated Invoice specifying the Invoice Number
     (c) 'q' -> To quit the system
  3.The System enables the Shopkeeper to add products in the Invoice
     (a) Command 'c' is used by the shopkeeper to continue adding products in the Invoice
     (b) Command 'g' is used by the shopkeeper to stop adding products and generate the Bill
  4.The System helps to keep track of User Data thus bonus points can be given.
  5.A constant of 2% of bill amount of the final bill is fixed as the bonus points to the user account
  6.The System also allows the Shopkeeper to generate the Invoice for anonymous users
  7.Users can use the bonus points to deduce the bill amount, if they wish to do so
  8.Shopkeeper can retrieve the details of a invoice by enetering the Invoice number
  9.Invoice number is an auto incremented integer generated by the System
  10.If the Invoice is cancelled in the future, points to deduce from or add to the user account is keenly kept track, however the code does not currently support
  deleting invoices
  11. LinkedList is used the basic data structure to accomplish the specified functionalities of the system.
  12. Chain of User Data is maintained globallt
  13. Chain of Products Purchased is maintained within the Invoice
  14. Chain of Invoices is maintained to access it using number
 
 The system can be further enhanced by adding the cancel invoice method and by replacing the linkelist of invoices with vectors of invoices in STL, thus increasing
 search efficiency.
