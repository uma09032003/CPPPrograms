## Problem Uniqueness and C++ Solution Perceptions ##
This repository is especially created to post C++ Solution for Problem Statements. Problems solved include basic **DSA Problems** especially the problems born out of observations. Coding is the unique language of modern science, Turing Complete and the classical expression in computer science literature guiding the syntax and semantics.
This page provides C++ Solutions, and discusses the appraoches to approach a problem. 

**#### 1. CodeEval.cpp ####**
**###### Problem Statement ######** : Create a function in C++ Language similar to eval in interpreted language like Python that is restricted to take in only the following characters.
                        **'+','-','*','/','%',All digits from 0 to 9 ,'(',')' and 'n' where n stands for variable n. **
