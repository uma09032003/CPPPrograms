## Problem Uniqueness and C++ Solution Perceptions ##
This repository is especially created to post C++ Solution for Problem Statements. Problems solved include basic **DSA Problems** especially the problems born out of observations. Coding is the unique language of modern science, Turing Complete and the classical expression in computer science literature guiding the syntax and semantics.
This page provides C++ Solutions, and discusses the appraoches to approach a problem. 

**1. CodeEval.cpp :**
**Problem Statement :** Create a function in C++ Language similar to eval in interpreted language like Python that is restricted to take in only the following characters.
                        '+','-','*','/','%',All digits from 0 to 9 ,'(',')' and 'n' where n stands for variable n.
                        
 **2. BookInventory.cpp**
 **The task is to design a Book Inventory Management System in C++, using Data Structures to store and process data that the CLI operations appear more sophisticated by the proposed design**
 
**The Project of Book Inventory System from CLI demonstrates the following features**
**Console management of Book Inventory System:**
1.	Since , the commands are given by the shopkeeper , the guide for commands is not displayed
2.	Commands used by admin
(a)	1-For Entering the data of Books
(b)	2-To display the entered data of Books (All the Books)
(c)	3-To display the transaction records
(d)	To Update the price of a book
(e)	To update the stocks of a book
      3. The entire program is divided into 2 sides , one for admin and other for user related  functions and the other for admin related maintenance
      4. In the console , the commands of “user”,”admin” are needed for appropriate switching,and “exit” to stop the running of the program
      5. Two Classes ‘class b’ and ‘class books’ are used where class b is used to represent the ADT of individual books and functions and ‘class books’ is used to represent collective operations on all books
      6. The program is so written such that the number of books once chosen cannot be altered . 
      7. Linked List is used to represent the transaction records (“Successful”,”Unsuccessful”,”Out of Stock”)
